- Does not change the hits to mine of many materials that take 2 hits.
- As a host, the carve size increase will affect everyone who joins your game. The reduced number of hits needed will only affect you.

- Less delay for helping you when grabbed and whatnot, faster move speed, more combat range.

- All upgrades have been upgraded to make them better and incentivize build specialty.
